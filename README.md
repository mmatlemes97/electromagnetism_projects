# Undergraduate Projects - Electromagnetism

Here are some of the projects about electromagnetism that I have developed during my undergraduate studies at the University of SÃ£o Paulo. They were written in Python and I used the JupyterLab as IDE. The projects are:

1 - Solving the Laplace equation for electric potentials and fields

2 - Electric potentials and fields for near charges

3 - Magnetic field produced by a straight conducting wire

4 - Magnetic field produced by circular current loops
