# Undergraduate Projects - Electromagnetism

Here are some of the projects about electromagnetism that I have developed during my undergraduate studies at the University of SÃ£o Paulo. They comprise a wide range of electromagnetic phenomena, from solving the Laplace equation numerically for the electrical potential to calculating the magnetic field for diffrerent geometric configurations.
